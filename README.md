# Hi, I'm Yuxing 👋

**Data & Infrastructure Engineer | ex-Meta | ex-Pinterest | ex-Nvidia | Scaling AI data pipelines**

I’ve spent my career building and operating large-scale distributed data systems — from billion-event/day pipelines at Meta, Pinterest, and Nvidia to designing lakehouse architectures with Iceberg and Delta. Now I’m focusing on **AI infrastructure**: the plumbing that feeds and monitors large models at scale.

---

## 🔧 What I’m Building
- **[kvstore-timed](https://github.com/weiyuxing22/kvstore-timed)** – Timed key-value store with TTL and snapshots (classic system design staple).  
- **[llm-dataset-pipeline](https://github.com/weiyuxing22/llm-dataset-pipeline)** – Data ingestion & sharding pipeline for LLM training datasets.  
- **[metrics-lite](https://github.com/weiyuxing22/metrics-lite)** – Lightweight metrics + tracing service for pipelines.

---

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Contributing to open source projects like **Hugging Face Datasets** and **Apache Iceberg**.  
- Leveling up Python (coming from Java) through real-world system projects.  
- Exploring reliability & cost trade-offs in large-scale AI data infra.
